Helps with migration from SimpleNote, Evernote and Google Keep to Obsidian
(or any other note-taking system that works with separate Markdown files).

For example, `bin/simplenote_to_obsidian.dart` takes the JSON that SimpleNote
[provides](https://simplenote.com/help/#export),
and massages it into Markdown files to be imported into Obsidian.

Absolutely no promises or warranties. No docs. If this helps you, good for you!
Otherwise, sorry!
